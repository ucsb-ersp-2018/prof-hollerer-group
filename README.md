## Welcome to Our ERSP Group Site!

We are second year CS undergraduates working in Professor Hollerer and Professor Turk's [Four Eyes Lab](http://ilab.cs.ucsb.edu/) as part of the [UCSB ERSP program](https://sites.google.com/site/erspucsb/home). We will be working in collaboration with the Bren School of Environmental Sciences for a cross-disciplinary research project called CrossRoads. 

## Current State of the Project
We are currently working to narrow down a research problem that can contribute to the CrossRoads Project as a whole. We are also in the beginning stages of writing a research proposal.

## Research Proposal
